# About the Authors

This is a page where everyone who adds to the 1lab can write a little
bit about themselves. I mean it: everyone can write a bit about
themselves! Try to follow the format of existing profiles [in the source
file], and keep the description short. Don't forget to mention your
pronouns.

Hi! I'm Amélia, a non-binary programmer/mathematician. I'm 19, but I've
been programming since age 7, and doing dependently-typed programming
since 14. Last year, I implemented [my own cubical type theory], to
figure out what it was all about.

Since then, I've realised that my energy would be better spent making
_existing_ type theories more accessible, and this project was the
result. The 1lab grew out of a personal project formalising category
theory to better my understanding of category theory, and it's currently
undergoing a rewrite from base Agda-with-K to Cubical Agda.

My other notable projects include [my personal blog], where I write
about type theory and the implementation of programming languages, and
[Amulet], a ML-family language with an advanced type system.

Hey! I'm Astra, a Canadian trans graduate student in mathematics.
Lately, my time has been equally spent divided between _"real math"_
(e.g. thinking about category theory), _"not-actual-math"_ (i.e.
operating Agda in autopilot mode), and hanging out with my friends.

A cool project that I recently completed was formalising a
[categorical glueing argument] for STLC.

Hey! I'm Reed! I develop proof assistants for a living, and write a _lot_ of Agda.
I'm interested in how we can make our tools more human friendly. In that vein,
I like writing various forms of automation, especially those with a more
semantic flavor.
