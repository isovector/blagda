I had a delightful experience this morning, where I fixed a real world problem
in my life with Haskell. It's rare that I actually get to *use* this stuff I
spend so much time thinking about, so thought it would make a nice and quick
blog post.


## The Problem

My apartment used to have some crappy roll-down blinds, which did absolutely
nothing for blocking out early morning light. As the master of my domain, I took
them down and installed more traditional curtains in their place, held up by a
tension rod. My tension rod is tensioned between the mounting plates for the old
blinds, which are metal. Unfortunately, the rubber pads of the tension rod don't
get much of a purchase on the metal, and so my curtains fall down once a week or
so.

They fell down yesterday, and I resolved that would be the last time.


## The Solution

I've recently bought a 3D printer, and like most new technology, it has taken
some time to acclimatize to. Having a mini-factory in your house is probably
pretty powerful, but so far I've just been looking for excuses to use it. There
are lots of weird projects on [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/) that I
keep trying to convince myself I need in my apartment.

But today was a turning point. The slippery mounting plate has some holes in it
--- so I realized I could manufacture a bracket that would sit in the mounting
plate and prevent my tension rod from falling again.

Armed with my [digital
calipers](https://www.amazon.ca/Digital-Measuring-Calipers-Conversions-Diameter/dp/B088R4XFBN),
I took some measurements of the plate, and quickly whipped up a CAD model using
the [`implicit` library](https://github.com/colah/ImplicitCAD) --- a library for
doing CAD modeling in Haskell:

```haskell
import Graphics.Implicit

main :: IO ()
main = writeSTL 0.25 "/tmp/mount.stl" $
  let base = center3 $ union
        [ slamBack $ slamTop $ centeredBox 40 40 6
        , slamBack $ slamBottom $ centeredBox 9 3.7 6
        ]
   in difference
        [ slamFront $ difference
          [ slamBottom $ union
            [ mirror (1, 1, 0) base
            , mirror (-1, 1, 0) base
            , base
            ]
          , translate (mk3 0 0 (-6))
              $ slamBottom
              $ cylinder (33 / 2) 10
          , translate (mk3 0 (-3) (-6))
              $ slamBottom
              $ cylinder (33 / 2) 10
          ]
        , slamFront $ slamBottom $ centeredBox 40 14.5 6
        ]
```

This program isn't going to win any awards and the magic numbers are petrifying.
But it's OK, because it saves to `/tmp` anyway. The result is a little bracket
that sits inside of the holes of the mounting plate and prevents the tension bar
from moving.

The tension of the rod pushes the pins into the holes, which prevent the bracket
from falling, which in turn holds up the tension rod. Amazing, really.

An hour of printing later, and my new brackets were done. They fit into the
holes just fine, and I can rest soundly knowing that the darkness of my room is
forever safeguarded.
