[Just kidding.](/blog/freer-yet-too-costly/) Turns out I couldn't put it down.

I want to announce my new library
[`polysemy`](https://github.com/isovector/polysemy#readme) --- it's
higher-order, no-boilerplate, zero-cost free monads.

I've been working nonstop on this for a few months now, so the commentary for
what the heck is going on will come after a little vacation.

Stay tuned.
