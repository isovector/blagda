Last night something strange happened. For a brief moment, the internet somehow
thought that my [criticism of Elm][elm] was more important to discuss than the
presidential election, because it was at the #1 spot on Hacker News.  I'm not
100% sure how things end up at the #1 spot on Hacker News, but it sounds like a
pretty desirable place to be.

My traffic yesterday was up three orders of magnitude from its average, so it
seems like now's as good a time as any to announce my new project:

[I'm writing a book!][book] It's a gentle introduction to computer science, from
first principles of electronics to category theory. If that sounds like the kind
of thing you might be into, you can find it [here][book].
