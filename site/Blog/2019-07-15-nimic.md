If you haven't heard, [I recently solicited couches to stay on][erdos]. The idea
is to cruise around the globe, meeting cool programmers, and collaborating with
them on whatever project they're most excited about.

This weekend I spent time with the inimitable [David Rusu][david]. The bar for
my trip has been set extremely high; not only is David an amazing host, but we
hashed out a particularly interesting project in a couple of days. We call it
[nimic][nimic].

Nimic is a free-form macro language, without any real syntax, or operational
semantics. We have a super bare bones parser that groups parenthetical
expressions, and otherwise admits any tokens, separated by whitespace. The
language will attempt to run each of its macros on the deepest, leftmost part of
this grouping structure. If nothing matches, the program is stuck and we just
leave it.

Therefore, hello world in nimic is just the stuck program:

```
hello world
```

which you have to admit is about as small as you can get it. The core language
installs four built-in macros; the most interesting of which is `macro` ---
allowing you to define new macros. The syntax is `macro pattern rewrite`, which
itself will be rewritten as the stuck term `defined`.

As a first program, we can use `macro` to rewrite the `defined` term:

```
macro defined (nimic is weird)
```

which will step to `defined` via the definition of `macro`, and then step to
`nimic is weird` via the new `defined` rule. Here it gets stuck and does no more
work.

You can use the special tokens `#foo` to perform pattern matching in a macro.
These forms are available in the rewrite rule. For example,

```
macro (nimic is #adjective) (nimic is very #adjective)
```

will replace our `nimic is weird` term with `nimic is very weird`. You can
bind as many subterms in a macro as you'd like.

Because nimic attempts to run all of its macros on the deepest, leftmost part of
the tree it can, we can exploit this fact to create statements. Consider the
program:

```
(macro (#a ; #b) #b)
; ( (macro (what is happening?) magic)
  ; (what is happening?)
  )
```

Here we've built a cons list of the form `(head ; tail)`. Our default evaluation
order will dive into the leftmost leaf of this tree, and evaluate the `(macro
(#a ; #b) #b)` term there, replacing it with `defined`. Our tree now looks like
this:

```
(defined
; ( (macro (what is happening?) magic)
  ; (what is happening?)
  )
```

where our new `#a : #b` rule now matches, binding `#a` to `defined`, and `#b` to
the tail of this cons cell. This rule will drop the `defined`, and give us the
new tree:

```
( (macro (what is happening?) magic)
; (what is happening?)
)
```

whereby we now can match on the leftmost macro again. After a few more steps,
our program gets stuck with the term `magic`. We've defined sequential
evaluation!

But writing cons cells by hand is tedious. This brings us to the second of our
built-in macros, which is `rassoc #prec #symbol`. The evaluation of this will
also result in `defined`, but modifies the parser so that it will make `#symbol`
be right-associative with precedence `#prec`. As a result, we can use `rassoc 1
;` to modify the parser in order to turn `a ; b ; c` into `a ; (b ; (c))`.

Therefore, the following program will correctly get stuck on the term
`finished`:

```
(macro (#a ; #b) #b)
; ((rassoc 1 ;)
;
( this is now
; parsed correctly as a cons cell
; finished
)))
```

The final primitive macro defined in `nimic` is `bash #cmd`, which evaluates
`#cmd` in bash, and replaces itself with the resulting output. To illustrate,
the following program is another way of writing hello world:

```
bash (echo "hellozworld" | tr "z" " ")
```

Note that the `bash` command isn't doing any sort of bash parsing here. It just
takes the symbols `echo` `"hellozworld"` `|` `tr` `"z"` `"` and `"`, and
dumps them out pretty printed into bash. There are no string literals.

We can use the `bash` command to do more interesting things. For example, we can
use it to define an `import` statement:

```
macro (import #file) (bash (cat #file))
```

which when you evaluate `import some/file.nim`, will be replaced with `(bash
(cat some/file.nim))`, which in turn with the contents of `some/file.nim`. You
have to admit, there's something appealing about *even the module system* being
defined in library code.

But we can go further. We can push our math runtime into bash!

```
macro (math #m) (bash (bc <<< " #m "))
```

which will correctly evaluate any math expressions you shoot its way.

Personally, I'm not a big fan of the `macro #a #b` notation. So instead I
defined my own sequent notation:

```
  rassoc 2 ----------
; macro (#a ---------- #b) (macro #a #b)
```

This thing defines a macro, which, when expanded, will itself define a macro.
Now David and I don't need to have any discussions bikeshedding over syntax. We
can just define whatever we want!

For a longer example, I wanted to implement pattern matching a la Haskell.

My first step was to define a lazy `if` statement. Because macros are tried
most-recently-defined first, I can define my operational semantics first. The
rule is to force the condition:

```
; if #cond then #a else #b
  ----------
  if !#cond then #a else #b
```

(the exclamation marks here are magic inside of the `macro` macro, which will
force macro expansion at whatever it's attached to) Next, I give two more
expansion rules for what to do if my condition is true and false:

```
; if True then #a else #b
  ----------
  #a

; if False then #a else #b
  ----------
  #b
```

Great! We can define syntactic equality of stuck terms by forcing two subterms,
and then checking them in bash for string equality:

```
; judge #a #b
  ----------
  is zero !(bash ([[ " !#a " == " !#b " ]]; echo $?))

; is zero #n
  ----------
  False

; is zero 0
  ----------
  True
```

We can try this out. `judge hello hello` and `judge (macro (a a a) b) defined`
both step to `True`, but `judge foo bar` steps to `False`.

Finally, we're ready to define pattern matching. We start with the base case in
which there is only one pattern we can match on:

```
; match #a of (#m1 -> #r1)
  ----------
  if !(judge #a #m1) then #r1 else (failed match)
```

We replace our match statement with an equality test, and produce `failed match`
if the two things aren't identical.

There's also an induction case, where we want to match on several possibilities.

```
; match #a of (#m1 -> #r1 ; #z)
  ----------
  if !(judge #a #m1) then #r1 else (match !#a of #z)
```

Here we'd like to perform the same rewrite, but the else case should pop off the
failed match.

Amazingly, this all *just works*. Let's try it:

```
; rassoc 3 =

; #a = #b
  ----------
  #a
  ----------
  #b

; not #t =
    match #t of
      ( True -> False
      ; False -> True
      )

; match (not True) of
    ( True -> hello
    ; False -> it works!
    )
```

This program will get stuck at `it works!`. Pretty sweet!

The core nimic implementation is 420 lines of Haskell code, including a
hand-rolled parser and macro engine. But wait, there's more! There's also an
additional 291 line interactive debugger, which allows you to step through the
macro expansion of your program. It's even smart enough to colorize the
variables in your source tree that are being matched by the current macro.

Not bad for a weekend of work. I can barely contain my excitement for what other
cool projects are on the horizon.
