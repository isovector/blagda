A discussion about roles broke out yesterday on [fpchat][fpchat] which is a
great place to hang out and talk about nerdy functional programming stuff if you
don't already know about it. Go sign up! Anyway, people suggested I clean up my
little soliloquy about roles and turn it into a blog post, so here we are.

You've heard of the type system, which makes sure your terms are sane. Maybe
you're also aware of the kind system, whose job it is to make sure your types
are reasonable! But did you know Haskell has an even more obscure system than
these? It's called the role system, and its purpose in life is to prevent you
from shooting yourself in the foot when dealing with *coercions.*

Coercions and roles have been around since 2014, but there's been surprisingly
little discussion about them in the blogosphere. In short, if two types have the
same representation at runtime, then it should be safe to coerce a value of one
into a value of the other. The role system is used to describe under what
circumstances such a coercion is legal.

To illustrate the point, let's talk about newtypes. Consider the following:

```haskell
newtype AnInt = AnInt Int
```

The promise of a newtype in Haskell is that it is zero-overhead; at runtime,
`AnInt` is exactly identical to `Int`. Newtypes are often used for adding
type-safety; it's nice if you have a `newtype Temperature = Temperature Int` and
a `newtype Money = Money Int` because the extra type wrappers ensure you can't
accidentally add the weather to your bank account, even if at the end of the day
they *are* both just integers.

`AnInt` and `Int` are not *literally* the same type, but they don't actually
differ at runtime. This property is known as being *representationally equal.*
If two types are representationally equal, we should be able to do the
equivalent of C++'s `reinterpret_cast` and just pretend like a value of one is
in fact a value of the other. Since these types correspond exactly at runtime,
this is usually a safe thing to do.

If `AnInt` and `Int` are the same type at runtime, it means we should be able to
`coerce :: AnInt -> Int` (and backwards) freely between the two types without
any problems. Morally, this `coerce` function is just `id`, because we're not
actually doing any work to the value.

Consider now the slightly more interesting type:

```haskell
newtype Identity a = Identity a
```

Again, because `Identity` is a newtype, we should expect `Identity a` to be
*representationally equal* to `a`. Since this is true, we expect that `Identity
AnInt` also be representationally equal to `Identity Int`, via `Identity AnInt
~-> AnInt ~-> Int ~-> Identity Int`. And thus, we should be able to `coerce ::
Identity AnInt -> Identity Int`. We can see that `Identity a` preserves the
coercion relationship of its type parameter `a`, and this property is known as
the `a` having role `representational`.

More generally, if the type parameter `a` in `F a` has role `representational`,
then `F X` is representationally equal to `F Y` whenever `X` is
representationally equal to `Y`. This works whether `F` be a `data` or a
`newtype`.

However, not all type parameters have role `representational`! Consider
`Data.Map.Map k v` which has keys `k` and values `v`. Because `Map` is
implemented as a balanced tree, it uses the `Ord k` instance to figure out where
to store a kv-pair.

One of the reasons we write newtypes is to give a different typeclass instance
than the underlying type has. For example, `newtype ZipList a = ZipList [a]` has
a different `Applicative` instance than `[]` does. In general, we have no reason
to expect that a newtype and its underlying type have instances that agree with
one another.

Which leads us to a problem. Because a value of `Map k v` is a balanced tree
which depends on the `Ord k` instance, we can't simply swap in `SomeOtherK` and
expect everything to work hunky-dory. They have different `Ord` instances, and
things would go screwy at runtime. All of this is to say that we **do not** want
to be able to `coerce :: Map AnInt v -> Map Int v` because it's likely to crash
at runtime.

However, it is still fine to `coerce :: Map k AnInt -> Map k Int`, because the
values don't have this implicit dependency on any typeclass instances. There are
no invariants to maintain on the `v` parameter, and so we are free to `coerce` to
our hearts' content.

The role system is what describes this difference between the `k` and `v` type
parameters of `Data.Map.Map`. While `v` is still role `representational`, `k`
has role `nominal`.

`nominal` coercions of the form `coerce :: a -> b` are allowed iff you already
have a proof that `a ~ b`, which is to say that `a` and `b` are literally the
same type.

There's also a third role, `phantom`, which, you guessed it, is given to phantom
type parameters (eg. the `a` in `data Const x a = Const x`.) Because phantom
types are by-definition not referenced in the data definition of a type, we are
always free to coerce a `phantom` type to any other type.

All of this cashes out in the form of `Data.Coerce`'s `coerce :: Coercible a b
=> a -> b`. GHC will automatically provide instances of `Coercible a b` whenever
`a` and `b` are representationally coercible. That means you get these
instances (and all of their symmetries):

* Given `a ~ b`, `Coercible a b`
* If `NT` is a newtype over `T`, `Coercible NT T`
* If `p` in `F p` has role `phantom`, `Coercible (F a) (F b)`
* If `r` in `F r` has role `representational`, `Coercible a b => Coercible (F a) (F b)`
* If `n` in `F n` has role `nominal`, `(a ~ b) => Coercible (F a) (F b)`

GHC is pretty clever, and has a role-inference mechanism. It works by knowing
that `(->)` has two `representational` roles, that `(~)` has two `nominal`
roles, and propagates from there. Every type parameter is assumed to have role
`phantom` until it is used, whence it gets upgraded to the more restrictive role
corresponding to the position it was used in. For example, if `a` is used in `a
~ Bool`, `a` gets role `nominal` since both of `(~)`'s parameters have `nominal`
roles.

GADTs are syntactic sugar on top of `(~)` so expect GADTs to have `nominal` role
type parameters. Furthermore, any parameters of a `type family` that are
scrutinized will also have role `nominal` (the motivated reader will be able to
find an interesting implementation of `unsafeCoerce :: forall a b. a -> b` if
this were not the case.)

This inference mechanism will give you the most permissible roles that don't
*obviously* destroy the type system, but sometimes it's necessary to explicitly
give a role annotation, like in the `Data.Map.Map` example. Role annotations can
be given by eg. `type role Map nominal representational` after turning on `{-#
LANGUAGE RoleAnnotations #-}`. It's worth pointing out that you can only give
*less* permissive roles than GHC has inferred; there's no fighting with it on
this one.

At the end of the day, why is any of this stuff useful? Besides being nice to
know, custom role annotations can provide type-safety ala `Data.Map.Map`. But we
can also get asymptotic performance gains out of `coerce`:

If `f :: Coercible a b => a -> b` (common if `f` is a newtype un/wrapper, or
composition of such), then `fmap f` $O(n)$ is equivalent to `coerce` $O(1)$ in
most cases[^1]. In fact, [mpickering][mpickering] has written a GHC source plugin
that will [tell you if you can apply this transformation][hashtag-coerce]. Cool!
