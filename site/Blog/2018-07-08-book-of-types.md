I've been working on a book about type-level programming in Haskell for a few
weeks now. I'm releasing the first three chapters today in order to gauge
interest, as well as get feedback on its style. If this sounds like something
that interests you, I'd love to hear from you. Thanks for your time!

You can find a very early pre-release of it
[here](http://samples.leanpub.com/thinking-with-types-sample.pdf).
