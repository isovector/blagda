After almost a year of work, I'm *thrilled* to announce the completion my new
book, [Algebra-Driven Design][add]. It's the culmination of two rewrites, and
comes with a beautiful foreword written by John Hughes, the inventor of
QuickCheck.

[add]: https://algebradriven.design

In the book, we take a fundamentally different approach to the software design
process, focusing on deriving libraries from equations, algebraic manipulation
and well-studied mathematical objects. The resulting code is guaranteed to be
free of abstraction leaks, and in many cases, actually writes itself.

If that sounds like the sort of software you'd like to write, I'd highly
encourage you to [give it a read][add].
