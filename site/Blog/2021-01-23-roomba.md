I spent the last few months making a roomba. I mean, sorta. I made a robot that
wanders around and ostensibly vacuums as it goes. But it gets stuck on things
all the time, and the floor isn't particularly clean by the time it runs out of
batteries. Nevertheless, it was an experience[^1] and I learned a lot, so I
though it would be a good idea to document. Consider the following a devlog,
one that might be interesting for the historical record --- but which I don't
suggest following to build your own roomba.

[^1]: I'm hesitant to call it a *good* experience.

This all started when I googled for "fun robot projects," and came across this
[terrible video][diy-robot]. It goes through building a little roomba
life-hack-style, which is to say, in absolutely no detail but vaguely making the
whole procedure look simple. They use some cardboard and a cup-noodle
container, so I thought "how hard could this be?" What I didn't notice at the
time was how the thing they build is not the thing they demo, nor how there are
crucial components that are completely disconnected. As it happens, this video
is completely smoke and mirrors.

I'd picked up some motors and a motor controller for a previous, [ill-fated
project][skateboard]. And I had an old sonar module lying around in order to do
the range finding. So I figured all that was left was a cup-noodles container
and a fan, and I'd be on my merry way.

Stupidly, I decided I wasn't going to make this thing out of cardboard. I was
going to design and 3D print the chassis and all of the fiddly little bits it
would require. My 3D printer's bed is 22cm square, which meant anything I wanted
to make was going to need to be smaller than that. My first prototype was shaped
like a flying disc, with a hole in the middle to put the noodles container, but
I learned the hard way that there simply wasn't enough floor-space on the disc
to fit all of the necessary electronics. Back to the drawing board.

I farted around with the base plate design for like a month, trying things. In
the meantime, I picked up some CPU fans, assuming that all fans are made
equally. This is not true --- CPU fans are good at moving air, but not good at,
uh... pressurizing air? or something? The idea is that a CPU fan won't force air
somewhere it doesn't want to go, for example, into a vacuum bag. For that you
want a blower fan, but I spent \$50 buying the wrong sorts of fans on amazon
before I figured this out.

Fans are measured in CFM, which is some sort of non-standardized measurement of
"cubic feet per minute." How much more imperial can you get? Non-standardized
here means that all fan manufactures have a different procedure for measuring
the CFM, so you can't just compare numbers. That would be too easy.

It took many weeks of not having my roomba suck enough before I realized that
fans move a constant *volume* of air, **not** a constant *mass.* The difference
is that, unless you have really good intake to your fan, it'll just make your
vacuum chamber really low pressure, and not actually translate into sucking hard
at the nozzle. I sorta worked around this by just mounting the fan directly
above the vacuum bag, which had a small cut-out to pull debris through. Pipes
seem to be anathema to small fans that you're trying to use as vacuum pumps.

I tried using some agitators to improve my suction by getting things moving. My
first attempt was via a gear train that I didn't realize was 10RPM --- way too
damn slow to get anything moving. I didn't feel like waiting around for another
amazon shipment, so I just tried running my 12V 2000RPM DC motors at 3V. It
sorta worked, but the handmade brushes I built dissolved themselves by still
spinning too fast. Since it didn't seem to improve the suction by much, I ended
up scrapping this idea.

While trying to prototype something together with alligator clamps, I
accidentally shorted my battery and caused no-small amount of smoke and did some
unintentional welding. Thankfully it didn't explode! I *was* doing stupid, unsafe
things with the battery, but I learned the wrong lesson from this --- that I
should properly solder all of my connections, even when prototyping. What I
should have learned instead was to make a really safe breakout connector for my
battery, and then play fast and loose with crimps and connectors from there. But
I didn't yet know about crimps and connectors, so I just hand-soldered
everything. It took forever and my productivity went asymptotically towards
zero. Especially because I didn't yet know what I was making, so there was a
*lot* of soldering and desoldering and resoldering.

To make things worse, I kept 3D printing half-figured out chassis --- each one
of which took like nine hours to print. Inevitably some part wouldn't fit, or
the suction would be off, or some other problem would arise. Cardboard next
time, my dude.

Oh, and did I mention that I don't know how to connect physical things, so I
just ended up hot-glueing everything together? Like, *everything.*

One day I was hanging out on IRC, describing my project when Julia Longtin said
"oh my god STOP. You're going to burn down your house!" She had correctly
noticed that I hadn't put a battery management system in front of my
battery. If you're a hobbyist like I am, you might not know that LiPo batteries
have a bad habit of catching on fire when you charge them after letting their
voltage drop too low. A BMS board watches the voltage on the battery and cuts
the circuit before it gets dangerously low. When testing this thing (after the
BMS was installed,) it turned off quite often, so I'm pretty sure Julia saved me
a ton in fire insurance claims. Thanks Julia!

The roomba's only sensor is a sonar module that shoots sound waves and listens
to hear when they come back. It's essentially echo-location, like what bats
have. Unfortunately for me, we also have the expression "blind as a bat," which
pretty adequately describes the robot. Sonar is a neat idea in theory, but in
practice it only reliably works up to about a foot in front, and cloth-covered
things like sofas muffle it. When added to the fact that DC motors offer no
feedback if they're stalled, it meant my roomba couldn't detect if it were
moving down a long hallway or stuck trying to drive into the couch. These are
two scenarios you really want different behaviors for.

But even worse, due to my design and the limitations of my 3D printer bed, I
couldn't figure out how to fit the wheels inside the robot and still get all of
the electronics and vacuum supplies on-board. As a compromise, the rubber tires
jut out about two centimeters. Which is just about ideal for getting caught on
chair legs and errant cables and walls and stuff like that. So if he hit the
wall at a 45 degree angle, he'd just get wedged there. And at 45 degrees, sonar
just bounces off of walls and doesn't return, so again, you don't know you're
stuck.

What a piece of work.

The software on this thing is a big state machine with things like "drive
forward" and "bounce off of driving straight into the wall" and "try relocate
because you've been stuck in the couch for too long." I expected the software to
be the easiest part of this project, since I'm an ex-professional software
engineer. But not so! Even after you discount the time I accidentally melted my
Arduino --- by... well, I'm not sure what, but definitely related to plugging it
into the computer --- the software didn't go smoothly. Arduino has this annoying
forced event loop where it calls `loop()` just as fast as it can, and you can
push back with a `delay(long milliseconds)` function call. But it's all in C++
(but without the STL) and so getting any real work done is annoying. And have
you ever tried to write a proper state machine without algebraic data types? I
walked away with the impression that I'm going to need to do a lot of work
improving the software end of things before I do another serious project with
Arduino.

In short, I spent a few months accidentally setting stuff on fire, waiting too
long for the wrong 3D shapes to print, and I all I got was this stupid T-shirt.
But I guess that's what learning feels like. But I've already bought a LIDAR
module and some bumpers for mk 2, so maybe I'm just a glutton for punishment.

If you're curious about actually building this thing, here's all of the source
materials. But please, do yourself a favor and don't put yourself through the
mental turmoil of trying to get it to work.


## Building One For Yourself

Don't. But if you do, you'll need these parts:

### 3D Printed Parts

The whole thing is written in a Haskell DSL for 3D printing called
[ImplicitCAD][implicit], because of course it is. Have you met me? The source
code is available [here][cad], where everything definition prefixed with `final_` needs
to be printed.

[implicit]: http://www.implicitcad.org/
[cad]: https://github.com/isovector/cad-models/blob/9a4eb494690293ee5c42859da1ae96d2b99b6840/src/Roomba3.hs

Oh yeah, and even after being very careful to model the negative space necessary
for the fan's exhaust, I forgot to connect that to the body of the roomba, so I
needed to cut the exhaust hole out with my soldering iron. The resulting smoke
was pretty noxious, so I just tried to not breathe too hard.


### Source Code

[Here's the code][code] I wrote for this thing. It's not beautiful, and
shouldn't be considered as evidence as to how I write real code that I care
abut. Sorry not sorry.

### Schematic

![Roomba schematic](/images/roomba.png)

What's labeled as the voltage source here should instead be the BMS. And no
promises that the pins on the Arduino correspond exactly with what the source
code actually does. I think it's right, but the roomba might drive backwards.
